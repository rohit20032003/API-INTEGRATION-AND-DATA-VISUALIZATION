Weather Dashboard Project

Overview

The Weather Dashboard project is designed to demonstrate how Python can be used to interact with an API, process data, and present the results visually. The project fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data to extract key parameters (such as temperature, humidity, and weather description), and visualizes the data using bar charts. This tool can be useful for anyone who wants to monitor and analyze current weather conditions for various locations around the world.

The project is modularized into separate Python files to maintain readability and reusability. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization.

Features

Real-Time Data Fetching: The program fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for any specified city.
Data Processing: Key parameters such as temperature, humidity, and weather description are extracted and presented for easy analysis.
Data Visualization: The weather data is visualized using a bar chart that compares parameters like temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity, providing an intuitive way to understand the current weather conditions.
Modular Codebase: The code is split into separate files (fetch_weather.py, process_data.py, and visualize_data.py), making it easy to understand, maintain, and expand.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Install the required Python libraries by running:
pip install requests matplotlib seaborn
A valid OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get an API key by signing up for a free account at OpenWeatherMap.
